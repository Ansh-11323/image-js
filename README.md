## Project rewrite

This project is being actively rewritten in TypeScript with a rethought API.  
Meanwhile, you can still find the documentation for the current version here: https://image-js.github.io/image-js/

You can also checkout the legacy branch:

`git checkout --track origin/daves_branch`
